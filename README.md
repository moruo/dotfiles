## How to install

Each sub folder contains a set of .* files in a certain OS.

To install to `$HOME`, just execute the `install.py` script inside a sub folder, or run `install.py <subfolder>`.

To update dotfiles in `$HOME` to sub folders, just execute `update.py` inside the sub folder, or run `update.py <subfolder>`.
